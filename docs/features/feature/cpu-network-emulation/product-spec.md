# Product Spec: CPU/Network Emulation

## Problem Statement

Performance testing web apps requires testing under various network conditions (Slow 3G, Fast 3G, 4G, Offline) and CPU constraints (slow devices, CPU throttling). Manually switching network profiles and CPU settings in DevTools is tedious. AI agents need programmatic control to test performance under different conditions and capture telemetry.

## Solution

Add `emulation` mode to the `configure` tool. Agent can apply network profiles (Slow 3G, Fast 3G, 4G, Offline, custom bandwidth/latency) and CPU throttling (1x, 4x, 6x slowdown). Extension applies settings via Chrome DevTools Protocol, captures performance impact via observe tool.

## Requirements

- Pre-defined network profiles: Slow 3G, Fast 3G, 4G, Offline
- Custom network: specify download/upload Kbps, latency ms, packet loss %
- CPU throttling: 1x (none), 4x, 6x, 20x slowdown rates
- Apply settings to active tab or all tabs
- Reset to normal (disable throttling)
- Capture performance metrics before/after to measure impact
- Persist settings across page reloads

## Out of Scope

- Simulating specific mobile devices (screen size, user agent) — separate feature
- Network packet inspection/manipulation
- Offline service worker testing (separate feature)
- Battery/thermal throttling simulation

## Success Criteria

- Agent can test page load under Slow 3G, observe LCP/FCP metrics
- Agent can apply CPU throttling, verify JS execution slowdown
- Agent can test offline behavior, verify error handling
- Settings apply immediately without page reload (except offline)

## User Workflow

1. Agent applies network throttling: `configure({what: "emulation", network: "Slow 3G"})`
2. Agent navigates to page or refreshes
3. Agent observes performance: `observe({what: "vitals"})` shows increased load times
4. Agent tests workflow under constraint (e.g., form submission)
5. Agent resets: `configure({what: "emulation", network: "reset"})`

## Examples

### Apply Slow 3G:
```json
{
  "action": "emulation",
  "network": "Slow 3G"
}
```

### Apply CPU 4x slowdown:
```json
{
  "action": "emulation",
  "cpu": 4
}
```

### Custom network profile:
```json
{
  "action": "emulation",
  "network": "custom",
  "download_kbps": 500,
  "upload_kbps": 250,
  "latency_ms": 300,
  "packet_loss": 0.05
}
```

### Offline mode:
```json
{
  "action": "emulation",
  "network": "offline"
}
```

### Reset all throttling:
```json
{
  "action": "emulation",
  "reset": true
}
```

## Notes

- Requires Chrome DevTools Protocol access (extension API)
- Settings persist across page reloads within tab
- Network profiles based on Chrome DevTools built-in presets
